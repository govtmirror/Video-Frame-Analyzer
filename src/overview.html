<p>The NARA Video Frame Analysis Tool (a.k.a "SAMMA Analyzer") is designed to automate and standardize the Quality Control (QC) checks that need to be performed on digitized video files.  </p> 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> 
<p>The NARA Video Frame Analysis application analyzes video frame level metadata generated by the digitization process.  The application allows a number pass/fail tests to be configured (RF level, Dropout, etc) and check against the metadata for each frame of video.  The application reports on files that have passed and files that have failed each analysis step.  For each failure that is identified, a detailed report identifies the time codes and frame ranges containing possible problems.</p> 
<p>Conceptually, the NARA Video Frame Analysis application could perform analysis of video metadata generated from a variety of digitization systems provided that frame-level data is generated in a readily parse-able format.  In its current form, the application is designed to analyze output from Front Porch Digital's SAMMA Video migration system.  As the SAMMA system digitizes video, it produces an XML file containing 37 technical properties (i.e. RF, luminance, dropout, etc) of each frame of video that has been processed.  The XML file also contains properties that apply to the entire file (i.e. frame count).</p> 
<p>The NARA Video Frame Analysis allows the user to configure a series of tests that will be performed against the generated XML files.  Each test falls into one of the following categories.
Compare a file-level property against a specific value.  An entire file either passes or fails based on this condition. 
Compare a frame-level property against a specific value.  Define the minimum duration in which the condition must exist in order to report an error. 
Compare the average value of a frame-level property (over a specified duration) against a specific value.  Define the minimum duration in which the condition must exist in order to report an error.</p>
<h2>BENEFITS</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the NARA Video Frame Analysis application is to reduce the manual effort required to QC digitized video files.  While the tool does not eliminate the need to manually review digitized video files, the tool can significantly reduce the effort required by prioritizing the output files that require more careful attention. When performing manual review of an output file, the tool highlights the time code sequences requiring the most diligent review.  At NARA, the use of the tool has cut the review time by 50%.</p> 
<p>Many steps in the review of video files are subjective.  The NARA Video Frame Analysis introduces objective criteria into the review process.  Assuming that the test conditions are well-suited to the collection being digitized, the application of these automated tests can provide an objective analysis of the quality of a collection.</p> 
<p>The NARA Video Frame Analysis application contains an interface that allows a user to define the "analysis set" to be performed.  An analysis set contains the test(s) to be performed as well as the range of values that will pass or fail a specific test.  Analysis sets can be refined to closely match the condition of a video collection.</p>
